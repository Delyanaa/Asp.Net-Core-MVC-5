# SportsStore-
SportsStore follows the classic approach taken by online stores everywhere.
It is an online product catalog that customers can browse by category and page. It has shopping cart
where users can add and remove products, and a checkout where customers can enter their shipping details.
There is also an administration area that includes create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) facilities for
managing the catalog, and it's protected so that only logged-in administrators can make changes.
The idea behind SportsStore is to make some sense of what real MVC development is like. I want to focus on ASP.NET Core MVC so I have
simplified the integration with external systems, such as the database, and omitted others entirely, such as
payment processing
